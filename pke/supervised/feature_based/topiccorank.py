"""TopicCoRank supervised keyphrase extraction model.


TopicCoRank is a supervised graph-based ranking approach to keyphrase
extraction that operates over a unified graph that connects two graphs: the
former represents the document and the latter captures how keyphrases are
associated with each other in the training data. The model is described in:

* Adrien Bougouin, Florian Boudin, and Beatrice Daille.
  Keyphrase annotation with graph co-ranking
  *Proceedings of the COLINGs*, pages 2945â€“2955, 2016.
